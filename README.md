# assignment-week01
I've really enjoyed the week on the course and I've felt truly like I've learned 
new and imporatant skills already. I find the teaching style really beneficial for me and I've gain confidence in areas I have been stressed over before while noting down any easily overlooked errors to ease work flow in future. 

I did find aspects challenging but by repeating code and practicing, this has helped me start ingraining some of the fundimentals. Specifically I've found small typos to be a time eater and positining a little tricky at times but after a while it has sunk in. 

I'm also a little nervous with Javascript and values right now although it's very fun and exciting to me. I've mostly been able to follow what we've done so far and implimented other Javascript interactions on my assessment. I also don't feel too confident in ordering childs and linking styling using that method yet so that's something I plan to look deeper into. 

I feel it is going to practoce and can see major improvemnets already in speed, knowledge and understanding!
